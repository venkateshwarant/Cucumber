# Cucumber_Tutorial
Getting started with Cucumber BDD framework

## General overview
This tutorial aims in writing behaviour driven test cases by integrating cucumber and selenium. Similar to the previous tutorials we will consider the [Web-based Hello World case study](https://github.com/acapozucca/helloworld) as our product to be tested. 
The test cases will be similar to that of [TestNG tutorial](https://github.com/acapozucca/TestNG), but here we will use the combination of JUnit-Cucumber-Selenium. JUnit for test cases, Cucumber for Behaviour driven development, and Selenium to write user acceptance test for our hello world web application.


## Assumptions/Pre-requisites

### Hardware
Laptop with at least 8 Gb memory (recommended 16 Gb, ideally 32 Gb)

### IDE
In this tutorial we will use IntelliJ IDEA, because it has a [IntelliJ IDEA Cucumber for Java plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7212-cucumber-for-java) to make our life easier.
